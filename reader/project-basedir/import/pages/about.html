<h3>About</h3>

<p>This site&#39;s focus is <b>lightning network</b>, <b>BOLTs</b>, and <b>operating a lightning node</b>. We welcome posts that are:
<ul>
    <li>detailed and specific, written clearly and simply</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>No question is too trivial or too &quot;newbie&quot;.</p>
<p>But we recommend that you see if your question has already been asked (perhaps
    even answered!) before you ask. But if you end up asking a question that has been asked before, that is fine too.
    Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help future visitors find their way.</p>
