Q&A website powered by lightning network

This website's source code (ln-central) is a software fork of [Biostar-central](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central). Biostar-central is a forum focusing on bioinformatics, computational genomics and biological data analysis. However, this fork was done to better serve the the lightning network community. For example, ln-central has been integrated to use anonymous lightning network micro-payments instead of traditional Single Sign-on.


## Biostar: Building Scientific Communities

[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](http://doge.mit-license.org)

Biostar is a Python and Django based Q&A software.
It is a simple, generic, flexible and extensible Q&A framework.

The site has been developed by **scientists and for scientists**. It aims
to address the requirements and needs that scientific communities have.
Biostar is used to run several science oriented Q&A sites:

 * Lightning Network Q&A at: https://ln.support
 * Biostars Bioinformatics Q&A at: https://www.biostars.org
 * Bioconductor User Support: https://support.bioconductor.org

The software is open source and free to use under the MIT License.

### Features

* Q&A: questions, answers, comments,voting, reputation, badges, threaded discussions, bounties
* Lightning Network integration
* Low resource utilization and easy deployment

### Documentation

The documentation:

* [Manage](docs/manage.md)
* [Deploy](docs/deploy.md)

The source for the documentation can be found in  the [docs](./docs) folder.

### Quick Start

Prerequisites:
* Python 2.7
* Python 2.7 virtualenv
* Python 3
* Python 3 virtualenv

From the Biostar source directory:

    # Install virtualenv
    sudo pip2.7 install virtualenv
    sudo pip3 install virtualenv

    # Clone source code
    git clone https://github.com/alevchuk/ln-central
    cd ln-central

    # Initialize virtual envrionment and install the requirements.
    ./biostar.sh install

    mkdir ~/log

    # Initialize database, import test data, index for searching
    ./biostar.sh init-dev import-dev index-dev

    # Run the server
    ./biostar.sh run

The `www.lvh.me` domain resolves to `127.0.0.1` your local host 
with a proper domain name. You may just as well use `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

If you accidentally go to HTTPS, instead of HTTP, then you'll get an error that looks like this:
> UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xfc in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)

Visit `http://www.lvh.me:8080`, not HTTPS, to see the site loaded with demo data.

Enjoy.
